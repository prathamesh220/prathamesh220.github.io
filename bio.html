<h2>About Me</h2>
        <p class="p5"><span class="s1">Hi! I am a Research Scientist at <a href="https://www.propheus.ai/"><span class="s3">Propheus</span></a>. I consider myself extremely fortunate to be part of a profession that allows me to constantly learn, innovate, and uncover mysteries for a living. </p>

<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Previously, I was  a Research Fellow at the <a href="https://www.nus.edu.sg/"><span class="s3">National University of Singapore</span></a>. I was hosted by <a href="https://vyftan.github.io/"><span class="s3">Prof. Vincent Tan </span></a>and <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~scarlett/"><span class="s3">Prof. Jonathan Scarlett</span></a>.</span></p>

        <p class="p5"><span class="s1">I received my Ph.D. degree from the <a href="http://www.ece.iisc.ernet.in/"><span class="s3">Department of Electrical Communication Engineering</span></a>, <a href="http://www.iisc.ernet.in/"><span class="s3">Indian Institute of Science, </span></a>Bangalore, India, where I was advised by <a href="https://ece.iisc.ac.in/~htyagi/"><span class="s3">Prof. Himanshu Tyagi</span></a>. I got my Masters's degree from the <a href="http://www.ieor.iitb.ac.in/"><span class="s3">Industrial Engineering and Operations Research Department, IIT Bombay,</span></a> Mumbai, India, and my Bachelor's degree from the Electronics and Communication Engineering Department, <a href="http://https//www.somaiya.edu/kjsce"><span class="s3">K.J. Somaiya College of Engineering,</span></a> Mumbai, India.</span></p>

        <p class="p5"><span class="s1">Before joining NUS, I was a research scientist at <a href="https://www.huawei.com/en/"><span class="s3">Huwaei RnD,</span></a> Bangalore. At Huawei, I worked broadly on online prediction problems in computational advertising. In the past, I have also held research positions at the Indian Urban Data Exchange and the TCS Innovation Labs.</span></p>

        <p class="p5"><span class="s1">Most of my academic research is  at the intersection of information theory and stochastic optimization. My recent research includes developing communication-efficient algorithms for federated learning and understanding the bottlenecks imposed on federated learning due to information constraints such as limited communication, computation, and privacy. I have also worked on entropic compression for timely information updates. In the past, I have used discrete event system simulation and mathematical programming for academic research and industrial projects.</span></p>

        <p class="p5"><span class="s1">My Ph.D. thesis won the Seshagiri Kaikini for the Best Ph.D. thesis from ECE Dept. IISc and was a runner up for the IKDD Best Doctoral Dissertation in Data Science Award. For my work on entropic compression for timely updates, I was awarded the best student paper award at the IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory, 2018. I was also a recipient of the Wipro Ph.D. Fellowship and a finalist for the Qualcomm Innovation Fellowship, 2018.</span></p>
